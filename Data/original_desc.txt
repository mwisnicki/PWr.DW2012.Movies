Movies Database Documentation
This the Master file on [brambles]/MyDocs/mov/doc.html; copyright 1996, 1997, 1998 Gio Wiederhold
Loaded into DB web files 25 September 1997. Updated December 1998.
This material was entered by Gio Wiederhold
The initial objective was as test data for students, to allow non-trivial exercises. There are fields suitable for complex joins, outerjoins, temporal joins, and recursion. It has also been used to investigate object-structured database technologies

This is a HTML version of the description of the movies database. It was based originally on the description from the Kamens and Wiederhold temporal paper. It also contains literature references in appendix A.
1. Introduction
The database was used originally in implementing the temporal queries in SQL is Wiederhold's movies database (see [21]) and for a number of other projects, both in Stanford classes and by research at the Un.of Maryland and others.. The database allows testing of theories about an implementation. Since it contains "real data", it allowing checking of results for semantic as well as syntactic correctness. Finally, the tables in the database consist of both journal and history relations (see 21, section 3), allowing us to test all of the different elements of an implementation.

The Overview section (2) below contains a summary of all the files and the URL pointers to them, or their parts or sections; see Section 3 for a full schema description.

A number of the fields are unsuitable for relational implementation, because they contain sets of values. These are best used in an object-capable implementation. The schema describes when such sets are to be expected. Encodings for several of the fields are listed in Section 4..

At the end of this document, in Appendix B., are some conversion rules for converting the HTML format to fields for relational or object databases.
2. Overview:
The central file (MAIN) is a list of movies, each with a unique identifier. These identifiers may change in successive versions. The actors (CAST) for those movies are listed with their roles in a distinct file. More information about individual actors (ACTORS) is in a third file. All directors in MAIN are listed in a fourth file (PEOPLE), with a number of important producers, writers, and cinematographers. A fifth file (REMAKES) links movies that were copied to a substantial extent from each other. The sixth file (STUDIOS) provides some information about studios show in MAIN. This documentation file provides supplementary information, and is an essential part of the database. Some images are also available, but not on-line now. There are many cross-linking names throughout the files, so many in fact that web browsers have choked when trying to make them live. Currently we simply try to be careful in naming films and people consistently. More detail follows below. Counts have been made using emacs `count-matches'.
2.1 -- MOVIES --
The main movies file is main.html. It contains 11435 `tr/td' table row entries (July 1999). It is complete for Hitchcock movies and TV shows, and has most films that can be related by topic, actors, director, history, and such to those films. It has also many films corresponding to a variety of interests of mine, former students etc., with an emphasis on historical value. MAIN is the "central" relation in the database; it is a journal relation that contains information about the movies themselves. The relation contains information about movies such as their titles, type, directors, and producers, as well as their year of release.
There is also a subset file of 82 Hitchcock full length Movies.

2.2 -- ACTORS --
The file actors.html has 6813 `tr/td' table row entries (July.1999) for many of the actors appearing in CASTS.
Also First part and Second part of actors.html, not maintained.
The key of the relation is "stagename", and there are intervals indicating the dates that the actor worked and the actor's lifetime. Other information in this relation is the actor's real name, background, and the type of roles he/she typically plays. References to images are kept here too.
2.3 -- DIRECTORS --
in file people.html The file lists all directors, as well as some other movie people, as producers and cinematographers (A total of 3290 `tr/td' table row entries, 3011 `@' directors as of July 1999).
The directors table is similar to the actors table in that it contains intervals for when the director worked and when he/she lived. The key of the relation is the field "name", which is the name under which the director directed. Director's key names do not contain any blanks. Typically the last name is used, when needed prefaced by an initial. A secondary unique key is defined for each director, up to three letters, based on the initial letters of the first, middle, and last names. This key will provide HTML HREF linkages among many of the files. As with the actors table, this table also includes the real name of the director among its fields ("lastname" and "firstname"). It also contains importat producers, cinematographers, musicians and composers, etc.
2.4 -- STUDIOS --
in file studios.html are important studios only (203 `tr/td' entries, sparse information).
The key of the studios relation is the name of the studio. The temporal information that is included is an interval indicating the years the studio was (or is) in operation, represented by the fields "startdate" and "enddate". This is a history relation.
2.5 -- CASTS --
in file casts.html This is a large (too large?) file of who acted as what in which movie. (46 009 tr/td entries, only partial for movies and roletypes, July 1999). Casts is an association relation, linking actors with movies. The key of the relation is the catenation of the two fields "film_id" and "actor"; no temporal information is included in this relation.
This file was too big for Netscape in 1996, so that also five working subsets were made available, however these are not kept up-to-date.

   1. casts of Hitchcock films;
   2. casts Part 1, directors coded A-B;
   3. casts Part 2, directors coded C-H;
   4. casts Part 3, directors coded H-O;
   5. casts Part 4, directors coded P-Z;

The four parts are still large files (6000-15000 entries; castsCH includes Hitchcock films
2.6 -- REMAKES --
in file remakes.html (1278 `tr/td' entries in July 1999).
This table (which is not extensively used in the temporal DB paper) gives information about movies that are remakes of other movies. It is very useful to test recursion in databases.
2.7 -- SYNONYMS --
This file has been superseded. All entries are now in the main file, as Alt(T:...) in the notes field. synonyms.html, contained 379 entries in Sep 1997) This list relates to the MOVIES in main.html.
Some movies are known by alternate titles, and can be accessed indirectly via this file..
2.8 -- QUOTES --
in file casts.html QUOTES. A few (26) memorable quotes from movies are listed in quotes.html.|1.
2.9 -- AWARDS --
in file actors.html. Types of awards and the awarding agencies are in awtypes.html.
2.10 -- AWARDS-RECEIVED --
is no longer a distinct file Awards received for special occasions are listed with individual entries in the files for ACTORS (actors.html).or MOVIE PEOPLE (people.html). Regular awards associated with a particular movies are given in MOVIES (main.html) and with a particular performance are listed in CASTS (casts.html).
2.11 -- REFERENCES --
Books that provided material for this database are listed within this documentation file as Appendix A.
2.12 -- GEOGRAPHY --
Codes for countries and origins are listed within this documentation file as section 4.3: doc.html GEO.
2.13 -- CATEGORIES --
Codes for movie categories are listed within this documentation file as Section 4.4: doc.html CATS.
2.14 -- COLOR-CODES --
Codes for color processes used for movies are listed within this documentation file as Section 4.5: doc.html COLS.
2.15 -- ROLE-TYPES --
Codes that specify role-types for actors are listed in the preamble for casts.html ROLES.
2.16 -- FIELD-IDENTIFIERS --
Codes that identify subfields in various files are listed within this documentation file as Section 4.2: doc.html FIELDS.
2.17 - AWARD TYPES --
Lists the award types used in MAIN, ACTORS, and PEOPLE, with the organizations who award them, and the span of years they were awarded.
2.19 -- IMAGES --
there is a small collection of .tiff files for actors and directors. They are kept individually in an images subdirectory.
2.20 -- ICONS --
There are about a dozan icons to be used to identify subfiles. Some of them come from the New Yorker Magazine Jan.1993. There are kept individually in an icons subdirectory.
3. Schema Definition for the Movies Database
Here we give a detailed description of the schema of the movies database, which is used for all examples in this paper and was used to implement the temporal SQL additions. General descriptions are given in Section 2, above.
This file is being updated to desctribe the HTML version. Where updates were made, the old material is in curly {brackets}.
3.1 The MOVIES Table
Col-Name = Description
. There is a distinct table for each director (Hitchcock has multiple tables, one for early silent, one for British, one for American, and one for TV movies).
The tables are broken up p by year of first known film by the directors. There are some break and header records for each year.
Each director table has two types of records:

   1. one header record for the director, with the director id, as shown in people, the first year known for movies by that director, prefixed by an @ symbol, matching the people entry, and the standard name for the director, also matching the people entry.
      The remainder shows the format for the data records that follow below.. The note field is often used to describe the set of detail records
      For movies where the director in not known there is a dummy entry, either by topic (Unknown) or by year (UnYear), as shown in the people file.
   2. any number of records, one per film, formatted as shown below. 

film_id =

    * An internally generated id for the film. This is the key of the relation entries and is unique. It is composed of director_id and a sequence number. .
    * All movies of a director are listed together in sequence, but only for some directors have all movies been entered..
    * The sequence numbers often have gaps to allow insertions when all movies for this director were not known at entry time at time of entry, a common occurrence. 

title =

    * The film's title. It is preceded by T: or Tn: (earlier also \Tm,\Tmm) depending on the source of the data. This field is not neccessarily unique.

year =

    * Year the movie was released. This is assumed to be an event (i.e. to take zero time)

director =

    * Director of the movie, preceded by D:. The standardized id-name is used. All directors must appear as DIRECTORS in people.html, so that we have a proper reference constraint.
    * If there are multiple candidate directors the primary one or the one who finished the movie is chosen and other candidates are given in the notes field as CoD().

producers=

    * Producer(s) of the movie, preceded by P: if shown in people.html and hence referencable by id_name .
    * P: alone shows that there was no specific producer.
    * If prefaced by PN: then the full name(s) is(/are) given; if prefaced by PZ: then the spelling is uncertain. In both cases no reference to people can be expected.. PN: is common, since only few id-names for producers exist yet in the people.html files, except for producers who also were DIRECTORS
    * :PU alone means the producer is unknown to me.
    * Multiple producers are permitted and common.

studios =

    * Studio(s) where the movie was filmed. Common studio names appear in STUDIOS. If the studio is not known or uncommon its location may be given as SL:{COUNTRY-CODE}.
    * Unknown studios are prefixed by SU:
    * sometimes the distributing studio, where the distributor differs from the production studio, is shown prefixed by SD:. 

prc =

    * Process used to make the movie (e.g. black and white as `bnw', col). Color processes may by specified as \COLOR-CODES. The code `cld' is used for black-and-white movies that have been colorized. Unknown is coded prc.

cat =

    * Category of the film (e.g., suspense, mystery), as given in the list of CATEGORIES. Unknown is coded Ctxx.

awards =

    * Awards received by the film, separated by commas. The awards are listed in AWARD (optionally followed by keywords such as 'Special') and included actual awards as well as favorable (mostly) mentions in compendia as Halliwell and Roger Ebert's books, with the appropriate number of stars. A + symbol is a half star and a - after the awardee code indicates a negative mention. Unknown is coded aw. -H means not in Halliwell [4].

lc =

    * Location where the film plays. Multiple locations are separated by semicolons (;), multiple levels in any location hierarchy are separated by commas, as `high-school, csd, CA'; indicating movie location is a California high-school in the countryside. Codes used are listed in the preamble of main.html. For countries other than the USA the country name is given as well. Alternatives for country names are `space' or `xxx ocean'. Unknown is lc. If the period of the film is significant it is given as T([[dd]mmm]yyyy).

notes =

    * Here a variety of notes is kept. The preferred order is chronological, as Book before Writer before Cost before Rating, but this has not been entered consistently.
    * . All entries have a FIELD-IDENTIFIER designator, as W(writer), R(rating), ... .
    * Fields as writers can have multiple entries, separated by commas. If an award is associated with an entry, as an academy award for the writers of a movie, it follows the name(s) after a semicolon (;). For authors (also music directors), the title is specified as B(author:book: "title")
    * Alt(T:title; reason) lists alternate titles, with a reason or date for the change, if known.
    * There is a general Notes field (Nt) which mainly record firsts, as first sound movie, etc. .
    * Er() means possible error in the record, to be checked sometime in the future from some source..
    * These note fields can be used to demonstrate the flexibility of object-based structures, but are best place in distinct fields in relational models.
    * Note entries SEEN and VT are private, indicating `when seen' or `have video tape' information.

3.2. The ACTORS Table
There is one record for each actor listed, but not all actors listed in CAST are documented. There are also break and header records for each letter of the alphabet.
Col-Name = Description

stagenm =

    * Stagename of the actor. This is nearly the key of the table. When an actor has used multiple names the last one used is preferred. There are a few actors with identical names. Then the birthyear (dob) becomes important.

    * Beginning of the "dates of work" interval: year of first movie

dowend =

    * End of "dates of work" interval.

birthnm =

    * Original last name.

    * Used mainly for Marriages(Mt), Lived-with(Lw), and Worked-with(W).
    * A code Cit(n) indicates how frequently the actor is cited in CASTS.html. This field is used for maintenance, as a weight of importance for completion of the data.

3.3 The PEOPLE Table
Directors are the major subset of the general people.html table. Other entries are significant producers, writers, art directors and some authors. Being a director is indicated in the Pcode field, and has some effect on other fields. There are also break and header records for each letter of the alphabet.
Col-Name = Description

id-name =

    * The name of the movie person in standardized form. These names are made to be unique. Intials may be prependended, and special character codes omitted. This field is referenced by the "director" field and by P:{references} in the MOVIES table. 

Pcode =

    * Code {PDWACGV} indicating that the movie person a Producer, Director, Writer, Actor, Cinematographer, choreoGrapher, or a Visual or art director. Just being an actor does not justify an entry here, for those see the ACTORS table. 

Did =

    * If the person is a director (Pcode includes D), then this field contains an internally defined, unique 2 or 3 letter identification code for the director, the director_id. It is made up by taking one or two letters of the first name, no or one letter of the middlename, and one or two letters of the family name of the director. Because of the high frequency of `John', it is encoded as `I'. This code is used a prefix to generate unique film_id's for all films directed by this director. 

yearstart=

    * First year of work, for directors the first year he/she directed a movie, it is preceded by a @. (start of the years interval).

yearend=

    * Last year of work, or that the director directed.

    * Date of Death, or 190x

backgrd =

    * The director's birth country. If unknown \Un.

notes =

    * This field is as in "actors". Female movie-people are identified as Ge(F), as a partial index. Special awards (not associated with a film) are shown as Aw().

The large CAST file is broken up into sections by initial letter(s) of the directors identifying code. In each section will be a number of directors, ordered by code. There is a distinct table for each director.
Col-Name = Description

   1. Each director table has two types of entries one header record giving the director's id, name, and format information.
   2. multiple records for each movie and listed actor. There are no headers for distinct movies. 

film_id =

    * Identifier of the film. All film_ids used here appear in MOVIES, and can be used as references.

title =

    * Title of the movie, prefixed by T.
    * A prefix of TZ is used when he entry is uncertain, as the actor's name.
    * The title field is actually redundant here, because is also given in MOVIES with the film_id. It is used to reduce the the chances of errors and to reduce requirements for "joins".

actor =

    * Name of the actor in this role, always using the standardized stage_name, if the actor is listed in ACTORS.html
    * This field presents only a partial reference, illustrating dangling pointers.
    * If unknown, but role is important, then `sa' is used for `some actor'.

roletype=

    * Type of the role. Similar to the "type" field in the ACTORS table, but always encoded by a ROLE-TYPE. \Und means unassigned.

role =

    * short description of the role prefixed by R:

    * If the name used in the role is significant (as in Biographical Movies), this role name follows in "quotes", as R:king "Henry V"
    * If only the role name is known, then the prefix is RN:
    * If the role is unknown, then only RU: is entered.

4: CODE TABLES
A fair amount of the information is encoded for consistency of reference. Directors' names are always treated as codes, and many other movie people as well. Names with out spaces are codes, and can be found in the PEOPLE relation. Actors names are treated as codes as well, although here first names have been retained. Many actors can be found in the ACTORS relation.
All movies have been assigned a code by catenating a director's identifier, found in the PEOPLE relation with sequence digits.
Several code tables appear below, other used are

4.2 -- FIELD-IDENTIFIERS --
Ancillary information, and social and professional relationships is frequently given as sub-fields in notes. Below are the prefixes used for such variable information. Some refer to candidate entries in other files. Many occur in the MAIN file, in the final NOTES field, others in the PEOPLE and ACTORS files. There should be only one sub- field of any type in the notes field, but they may have contain multiple entries If the contents references entries in a file, it is listed, but such a reference is only assured if coded with a colon ( : ). Some of these designations are repeated with the files themselves.

Appendix B: CONVERSION
This section refers to the original HTML files. The notes are still being developed.

To convert the source files from HTML format to another type of database:

(we use [] to denote HTML `french' brackets.)

   1. remove header notes
   2. remove miscellaneous HTML commands, as [HTML], [/HTML], [BODY], [/BODY], [HR], ...
   3. for relational files ignore all lines starting with [tr][th]. These are header lines suitable for schema definitions. They could also become the roots of large director objects for the main and cast files.
   4. remove tabs and carriage returns. All content lines end with [td]| .
   5. records are divided into fields, as documented in the file schemas above, by [td]. A space follows [td] entries, preceding the content of the next field. Missing fields are indicated by two `[td] [td]', or by `[td] dummy entry[td]', as indicated in the file descriptions above.
   6. Many fields can have multiple entries. Simple relational transforms may drop such fields, others may require normalized sub-relations.
      Multiple values in a field a separated by
         1. 1. `,' if the values are of the same type, as [td] Romt, Dram[td]
         2. 2. `;' or `:' if they are of different types, as W(Ben Hecht; AAN)
      If both `;' and `,' appear in a field, then the `;' typically distinguishes a major group relative to the `,' value separator, as [td] island, South Pacific; court, SF, CA[td].
   7. In the Note fields may be a variable number of different types of entries, each of the form
      TypeCode(field), as W(Eliot Stannard)
   8. When names of producers, writers, etc, in fields do not contain blanks, as [td] P:A.Hughes[td], then the name exists in the people.html file, and can be used as an interfile reference.
